# BoomBikes: 

Alongwith the solution, in this notebook, I tried to explain some of the additional functionalitis for seaborn and matplotlib.
I also explain how to validate the variouls underlying assumption of Liner Regression:
- Linear relationship between X and Y
- Error terms are normally distributed (not X, Y)
- Error terms are independent of each other
- Error terms have constant variance (homoscedasticity)
#---------------------------
I also tried to show what would happen when model will get unexpected value in any column (say 2020 in year column or a value equal to 4 in weathersit)

I have also referred to few blogs that explain how to read the output of the statsmodel summary.
