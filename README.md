# BoomBikes: 17th July 2022

Alongwith the solution, in this notebook, I tried to explain some of the additional functionalitis for seaborn and matplotlib.
I also explain how to validate the variouls underlying assumption of Liner Regression:
- Linear relationship between X and Y
- Error terms are normally distributed (not X, Y)
- Error terms are independent of each other
- Error terms have constant variance (homoscedasticity)
